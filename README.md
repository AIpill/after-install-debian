# Important steps after Install debian 

I create this shell based on [Mohammed Baser blog](https://mmbesar.github.io/Tutorials/Debian-12-Post-Install/) to help setup important things very fast after install a debian system or you can do it manual throe Mohammed Baser blog (link above).



## How to run

1. **clone repo** 
`git clone https://github.com/AIpill/after-install-debian`

2. **Change directory**
`cd after-install-debian` 

3. **Run install file**
`./install.sh`
